## What is it?
This library implements an set of different `ObservableDictionary<T>`, which generates `INotifyCollectionChanged` and  `INotifyDictionaryChanged` events. 
It is the companion to the `Gstc.Collections.ObservableList library`. Both are updates from the deprecated `ExtendedObservableCollection`, which was the basis
for both of these libraries. The code has very strong unit testing and provides example usage.

The Dictionary is just about ready to go, more updates will be added soon.
